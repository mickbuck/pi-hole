Like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48892448/error-unsatisfiable-constraints-using-apk-in-dockerfile did the following:

echo "http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing" >> /etc/apk/repositories
apk update
apk search --no-cache whiptail
RUN apk update \
    && apk add -u whiptail\
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

Checked https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/contents?file=whiptail&path=&name=&branch=v3.6&arch=x86_64 
Found the name is newt not Whiptail, DOH!
